*** Wild and crazy ideas. Or not.
   - JambdaIterator with Option<T> instead of next()/hasNext()
   - Y-combinator (unless we accept references to this from within an apply-method...)
   - Handle "Pure" funktions somehow. (annotations, constructor argument ...)
   - Add support for some basic parallelism.
   - Pre-cooked functions library
   - Rewrite everything in Sequence as lazy sequences (and remove Cell etc.)
