*** Wild and crazy ideas. Or not.
   - JambdaIterator with Option<T> instead of next()/hasNext()
   - Y-combinator (unless we accept references to this from within an apply-method...)
   - Handle "Pure" funktions somehow. (annotations, constructor argument ...)
   - Add support for some basic parallelism.
   - Pre-cooked functions library
   - Discuss Iterator and Iterable vs. JambdaIterator.
   - Discuss short vs. long and descriptive names.  
   - Make sure that all sequence operations are really lazy (some of them starts to read from its source on creation).
   - Implement concatenate and flatten.
   - Implement mapi
